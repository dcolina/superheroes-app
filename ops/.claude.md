# Project: Superheroes App - CI/CD and Deployment

## Goals
Define a modern, automated deployment pipeline for Superheroes App:
- GitOps-driven deployment using ArgoCD
- Kubernetes manifests templated with Helm charts (frontend and backend)
- NGINX Ingress with mkcert TLS
- GitHub Actions pipeline (build, test, delivery)
- Multi-environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Security best practices for Ingress
- GitOps strict (no manual changes in K8s)
- Alignment with platform engineering best practices

## Stack
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- ArgoCD
- NGINX Ingress Controller
- TLS with mkcert
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- GitOps flow
